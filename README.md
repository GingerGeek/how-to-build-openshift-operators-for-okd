# Purpose of this repository

Currently some of the operators available for OpenShift are not available in community catalogs of the Operator Hub and therefore not available for OKD out of the box.

It's possible to build the operators on your own being able to use them in OKD but because the build processes of the operators sometimes differ a lot, you can have a hard time doing that.

This repository will provide information about how to build OpenShift Operators so we can use them in OKD.

The description for each of the operators is stored in a separate directory to maintain some structure.
